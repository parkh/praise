# Praise

Another test project (you may have noticed that I have a bunch of them). Here I'm going to develop an application following the O'Reilly - ['Hands-on with React and Ruby on Rails'](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044307.do) course. One thing to point out, I'm not going to blindly copypaste the provided examples and there are going to be Songs with Comments in my app. Other differences to come.
